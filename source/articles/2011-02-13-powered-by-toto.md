So a few weeks ago my hosting expired and I was on the lookout for cheap (and ideally free) hosting.
My initial plan was to go with [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/) and learn a bit of Python along the way.
Then a friend suggested [Heroku](http://heroku.com/), another cloud based platform with similar sorts usage limits but this time
the language of choice was Ruby - a language that I have a passing familiarity with thanks to using it a little at work recently.

The same friend then pointed me at [Toto](http://cloudhead.io/toto), a tiny file-driven blogging platform and I fell a little in love.
This was exactly the kind of thing I'd been musing about for a long time, but was too lazy to build.

I'm not going to promise anything interesting shall appear here but setting up Heroku and Toto have removed what was a big barrier
to me publishing things on the net. Now creating a blog post is as easy as writing something in markdown, commiting it to Git and pushing.
No more dealing with FTPs and all that. Bliss.
