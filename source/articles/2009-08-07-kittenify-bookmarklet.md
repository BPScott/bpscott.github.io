**One Week Later**: WOO and YAY I've made it into [b3ta newsletter #391](http://www.b3ta.com/newsletter/issue391/) twice.
Once for the bookmarklet itself, and again for getting b3ta a bit of media coverage as Kittenfy appeared in both the
[online](http://theridiculant.metro.co.uk/2009/08/kittens-kittens-everywhere.html) and [print](http://www.flickr.com/photos/robmanuel/3807086473) editions of the Metro newspaper.
